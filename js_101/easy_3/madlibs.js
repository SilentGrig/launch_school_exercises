/*
 * Madlibs is a simple game where you create a story template with "blanks" for

 *  into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.
 *
 * Create a simple madlib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb,
 *  and an adjective, and injects them into a story that you create.
